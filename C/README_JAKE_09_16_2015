This is a readme for anyone who uses this code later.

The group that took the code from Jake Dennis that worked on the suit and combined it with
Madison Blake classifier messed things up completely.

I (Jake Dennis) have been working on integrating it correctly....
I have removed the heart rate thread.
I have removed the bp thread.

I have fix the calculation of the quaternions coming off the suit in the MotionCapture.cpp code.

I have added debug information in the main.cpp file where they call the classifier.
I expect the following:
Classify Thread Quat: ID_NUM [W,X,Y,Z]
I expect that they should be normalized, and that the 
limbs are [W,0,Y,Z] ALWAYS.
The Torso should have a rotation about Z which is roll in this case for the global axis.
