\subsection{Detailed Description}
General Structure for a sequence of characters. A sequence is a size N array of characters. Each character is of type CHARACTER.

It is assumed that each character has been pulled from some stream. sample\_\-rate defines that streams sample rate, how much time exist between C\mbox{[}i\mbox{]} and C\mbox{[}i+1\mbox{]}.
